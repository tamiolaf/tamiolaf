  "title": "About Me",
  "body": [
    "I'm a frontend software engineer based in New York City. I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, but realized I liked software more than hardware. I've done a few internships in fintech and I'm currently working as a software engineer for Block, Inc. I'm on the International Loans team where I build websites to help small business owners around the world apply for loans.",
    "Before that, I was a full stack software engineer based in Washington, D.C. working for BuzzFeed, Inc. My time there was split between the AdTech team and the BuzzFeed News team. On the AdTech team, I built ad units for BuzzFeed.com and worked on an internal ad manager to give business managers more control over ad campaigns. On the News team, I helped build products that enhanced the experience of our readers, and lighten the load for our reporters.",
    "When I'm not learning about the newest frontend JavaScript framework, I love playing music and skateboarding. I spend a lot of time trying out new recipes I found on Tik Tok. I'm currently learning more about open-source and web accessibility."
