        "I helped build a new ad unit to live on BuzzFeed O&O properties. A large selection of units is attractive to potential advertisers, especially video ones, so I developed a Native Instream Video Unit for my intern project.",
        "The new unit includes a custom video player and a playlist of BuzzFeed videos. It also includes a \"More Info\" button in case users want to watch more vidoes.",
        "The video player would pull in a pre-roll ad before playing the selected BuzzFeed video. The banner at the top displays the logo of BuzzFeed Brand that owns the video. This unit helped bring in over 750K+ in ad revenue."

        "My responsibilities included using html and css to build banners that matched the designs as well as vetting them for any accessibiity issues, such as insufficient contrast.",
        "Originally the Chinstrap displayed for every user anytime they visited a page unless they manually dismissed it. Most visitors on buzzfeed will view one page and leave, so this made sense at the time. We decided to take a new approach to the Chinstrap because we planned to build a more loyal, invested audience.",
        "I added new logic for the Chinstrap to make it less intrusive and more user-friendly. I made the Chinstrap display only after a user had scrolled through over 50% of the article they we're reading. That way we could disrupt fewer readers and promote to people who are the most interested. We also made sure the popup disappeared for at least a week after being dismissed. By the time the user saw the popup again, it would most likely be promoting something new.",
        "Popup is not visible on page load/nPopup appears when user scrolls down and scrolls back up\nPopup appears when user clicks another tab or window, and returns\nPopup doesn't appear when user is a member of Scroll.com\nPopup disappears for a week when it is dismissed by user",
        "as the accessibility lead, I also vetted designs that didn't have enough contrast or fonts that weren't accessible enough"
